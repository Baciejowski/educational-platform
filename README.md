## About
The aim of the project was to create a generic (not related to any school subject) game-based educational platform incorporating adaptive teaching
approach (the difficulty of the game adjusts itself to students' results in the game in real time).

Functions include:
- manage classes:
    - add/modify/remove class,
    - add/modify/remove students;
- manage game scenarios:
    - create/delete scenario,
    - upload plain text files for AI to generate questions based on them,
    - add/modify/remove questions,
    - accept/reject question difficulty proposed by AI,
    - accept/reject questions generated by AI;
- manage sessions:
    - assign a session to a class,
    - track the status of sessions assigned to particular students.
